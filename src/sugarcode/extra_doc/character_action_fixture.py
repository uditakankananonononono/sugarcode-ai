"""Row 1506, Character Education.

character_action_fixture screens supplied action x and reflection y
counts for equality and at least minimum actions. Returns sorted consistent
booleans, meeting labels, absolute differences and total_actions. Counts
are abstract and do not verify actions or values. No character judgment,
moral evaluation, learning effectiveness or educational recommendation.
Inputs: rows is an exact list or tuple of 1 to 8 entries. Each entry is an
exact list or tuple (label, x, y). label is an exact printable ASCII str
of 1 to 12 characters, unique across rows. x and y are exact ints from
0 to 10; bool and all subclasses are refused.
minimum defaults to 3, an exact int from 0 to 10.
Validation order: rows type, rows size, minimum, then each row in input
order (shape, label, x, y), then duplicate labels.
NOT_CLAIMED: character judgment, moral evaluation, learning effectiveness, production readiness.
